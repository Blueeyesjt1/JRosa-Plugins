At the moment, the 'map builder' does not save each time you place an object down. You must copy and paste from the terminal into the JSON file to be saved. This will make it that each time the server is reset, the map will be reloaded.
Controls:
     Z: Rotate on YAW
     Shift + Z: Rotate on ROLL
     Q: Rotate on PITCH
     R move forward
     Shift + R: Move slightly forward
     F move backwards
     Shift + F: Move slightly backwards

The parking lot is generated by a simple 2D grid and can easily be generated anywhere on the map. You're able to adjust how many cars spawn and how many are drivable.

<h3>Custom elevators:</h3>

</p>
I created this basic elevator-train system in hopes for easier vertical transport capabilities. This is very similar to the MovingTrain.lua file.

<h3>Custom train transport:</h3>

</p>
A custom train transporter that exponentially increases and decreases speed for effectient transportation and immersion. 
This has a similar structure as the elevator plugin but with a expontential velocity.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
A majority of the plugins have comments at the top to help understand the features.
Feel free to give this out to anyone. A credit at the top of the script is appreciated but not necessary.
