At the moment, the 'map builder' does not save each time you place an object down. You must copy and paste from the terminal into the <b>SpawnWorldPresets.lua</b> file. This will make it that each time the server is reset, the map will be reloaded.
Controls:
<ul>
  <li>/build (/b): Build with the item of your choosing: '/b 37', '/b box' (Builds with box (37) object)</li>
  <li>Left-click: Place object</li>
  <li>Z: Rotate on YAW, Shift + Z: Rotate on ROLL, Q: Rotate on PITCH</li>
  <li>R move forward, Shift + R: Move slightly forward</li>

</p>
The parking lot is generated by a simple 2D grid and can easily be generated anywhere on the map. You're able to adjust how many cars spawn and how many are drivable.

<h3>Custom elevators:</h3>

</p>
I created this basic elevator-train system in hopes for easier vertical transport capabilities. This is very similar to the MovingTrain.lua file.

<h3>Custom train transport:</h3>
<p align="center">

</p>
A custom train transporter that exponentially increases and decreases speed for optimized transportation and immersion. 
This has a similar structure as the elevator plugin but with a expontential velocity.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
A majority of the plugins have comments at the top to help understand the features.
Feel free to give this out to anyone. A credit at the top of the script is appreciated but not necessary.
