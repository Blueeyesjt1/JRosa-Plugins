At the moment, the 'map builder' does not save each time you place an object down. You must copy and paste from the terminal into the JSON file to be saved. This will make it that each time the server is reset, the map will be reloaded.

<h3>Parking lot generation:</h3>

The parking lot is generated by a simple 2D grid and can easily be generated anywhere on the map. You're able to adjust how many cars spawn and how many are drivable.

<h3>Custom elevators:</h3>

I created this basic elevator-train system in hopes for easier transport capabilities. This is very similar to the MovingTrain.lua file.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
A majority of the plugins have comments at the top to help understand the features.
Feel free to give this out to anyone. A credit at the top of the script is appreciated but not necessary.
